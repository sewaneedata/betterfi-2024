# Stop Predatory Lending
## What is Predatory Lending?
The Federal Consumer Protection Bureau estimates that, on average, 12 million Americans each year will take out predatory loans to cover an emergency expense. Predatory lending is a practice that takes advantage of low-income communities by exploiting their need for quick cash. Many lenders provide short-term loans that tend to be misleading and often have interest rates over 300%. These loans lead to a cycle of debt and only create more financial stress on the borrowers. 

Who or what is BetterFi?
We have partnered with BetterFi, a non-profit Community Development Financial Institution organization that offers affordable installment loans and coaching to help individuals break free from debt traps and become financially independent. We have been working with BetterFi to combat the predatory lending crisis in Hamilton and Rutherford counties by determining the most susceptible areas in these counties.
